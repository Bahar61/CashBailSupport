# CashBailSupport
Many people are being held in jail pretrial, meaning they have not yet been convicted of a crime and are legally presumed innocent.  This is because our country largely has a system of money bail,  in which the constitutional principle of “innocent until proven guilty” only really applies to the well off. With money bail, a defendant is required to pay a certain amount of money as a guarantee She/He will attend future court hearings.  When She/He is unable to come up with the money, he can be incarcerated from her/his arrest until his case is resolved or dismissed in court.  We created an app that helps to connect these individuals with a community, who wants to help and pay the cash bail, so an innocent or poor person doesn’t stay in jail because of lack of money.
